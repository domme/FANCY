Fancy Rendering Framework - Issues and Todos
=============================================
- Think about which format a TextureView should have on high-level for Depth- or Stencil formats. Currently, a view is created with a depth- or stencil format which is then resolved into an appropriate floating-point of uint format (e.g. DXGI_FORMAT_R24_UNORM_X8_TYPELESS for DXGI_FORMAT_D24_UNORM_S8_UINT). On Vulkan, there don't seem to be any special formats for views required.

- Get rid of the platform-specific TextureView(DX12/Vk)-specialization. GpuResourceView already has a nativeData-Any member. TextureViewDX12/Vk is only used for properly releasing the descriptor on DX12. That could also be done in the GpuResourceViewDataDX12-destructor.

- Support layered framebuffers
